      <h1>A Case For Pure HTML</h1>
      <h3>Kresten Jacobsen, 2019-08-24</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>There's like a gazillion fancy webframeworks, cool blog systems, static site generators, so why old timey <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>?</p>

      <p>My first and most important argument for html, is <em>durability</em>. If I find the source for this site in 20 years odds are that I'll still be able to view it immidiately in a browser with minimal work. I've tried doing the same with different kinds of frameworks and static site generators but they tend to change over time and may not be able to render the source files anymore.</p>

      <p>The second reason is <em>portability</em>. HTML kan be pushed to more or less every webserver in the world. As such nothing hinges on a specific setup and it is possible to move without notice.</p>

      <p>HTML is <em>secure</em>. HTML is in and of itself as secure as a text document. Because it <em>is</em> a text document. Where other languages relies on a webserver keeping secrets (e.g. password to a database as with PHP & Wordpress) HTML doesn't need any of that.</p>

      <p>The fourth good reason for choosing to write in HTML is that it's <em>simple</em>. HTML is pretty straight forward - and if you want to you can read the full source for this site and edit it offline. I can use any editor I want on any computer. When I write a new post I just copy the old one and delete the content (I did that anyway with the static site generators).</p>

      <p>Oh, and it's <em>fast</em>. Of course while you certainly can write slow sites by hand at least your in change. This site should load in less than a secon. If not something have gone wrong.</p>
